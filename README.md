Voicebot Project

Voicebot is an advanced voicebot designed to assist with scheduling meetings, retrieving the current time, and checking available slots in the calendar. If the suggested time is occupied, the voicebot proposes the next available slot. The agent collects necessary user information for scheduling the meeting. Additionally, the voicebot logs the conversation transcript in Google Sheets along with a summary tailored to highlight key conversation points, providing context and understanding of the client's needs. The agent has a personalized knowledge base to refer to specific data during conversations. If the user does not wish to schedule a meeting, the agent resolves the user's issue. If the meeting is finalized, the agent creates an event in Google Calendar with the scheduled time, meeting topic extracted from the conversation transcript, and user details.

Project Purpose

The purpose of the Voicebot project is to create an agent that schedules meetings in Google Calendar and generates conversation summaries. This allows you to understand the client's needs and context of the meeting before it takes place. The project aims to streamline the meeting scheduling process and ensure better preparation for client interactions through natural voice conversations.
